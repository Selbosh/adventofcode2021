# Advent of Code 2021

[![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/Selbosh/adventofcode2021/actions/workflows/r.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Selbosh/adventofcode2021/actions)

*By [David Selby](https://selbydavid.com)*

This repository contains some of my attempts to solve programming
puzzles in the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021). I
will be mostly using the programming language R, with data and solutions
presented as this downloadable R package.

## Installation

Install the package from GitHub with

``` r
remotes::install_github('Selbosh/adventofcode2021')
```

## Development

Most puzzles in the Advent of Code include a few simple examples of
input and expected output, before asking you to apply code to a larger
dataset. We can incorporate these into a *test-driven development*
framework by writing them as expectations in the `tests` folder.

Write a `test_that` expectation for each day, or part thereof, with
these example inputs and outputs. Then, we donâ€™t attempt to run our code
on the main puzzle input until it generates the expected output for all
of these tests.

## Usage

To print the numerical outputs, we can write vignettes, add our working
to the GitHub `README.Rmd` file, or else write scripts in the `inst/`
folder and to `source()` when required.

``` r
library(adventofcode2021)
get_solution(1)
#> [1] 1266
#> [1] 1217
get_solution(2)
#> [1] 1746616
#> [1] 1741971043
get_solution(3)
#> [1] 4191876
#> [1] 3414905
get_solution(4)
#> [1] 64084
#> [1] 12833
get_solution(5)
#> [1] 5167
#> [1] 17604
get_solution(6)
#> [1] 391888
#> [1] "1754597645339"
```
